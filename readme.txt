The folder entitled 'NUFV137_resubmission' contains all data and code to produce results presented in Figure 4, Fig S5.

The folders 'parsimony' and 'bayesian' contain executable nexus files (labeled 'runfiles'), which can generate all of the other files in each folder. Running these requires installation of paup* and Mr Bayes. Versions numbers for these are provided in the manuscript text.

The folders 'apolist' and 'autodecay' can be run after the parsimony analysis is complete. Both of these folders contain individual readme files that provide detailed instruction for how to run those analyses.

The folder 'plotting_trees' contains an R script that produces PDFs (plot_all_trees.pdf and plot_Fig4.pdf) showing the results of these analyses. These outputs were edited in Illustrator to set dimensions, line thickness, figure paneling, and fonts.
